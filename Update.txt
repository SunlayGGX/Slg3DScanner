- Compute surface plane and normal
- Box-tree (kd-tree, or whatever its name...)


23-10-2017  -  3.15am
- Added Eigen Librairy dependencies
- Separated Inputed Cloud Vertex (inputed as just an array of sparse 3D points) from Rendered Cloud Vertex (final, will have more than just points)
- Added some mathematics implementation (covariance matrix creation, centroid computation, linear least square, eigenvalues and eigenvectors using Eigen library, ...)
- A lot of research for making normals using a set of points...
